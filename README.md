# **Resume Modal**

###### **Objective:**
This week's exploration goal is to create a modal that allows users to view my resume without having to open in a separate window. I also wanted to give my users the option to download a pdf of my resume so if they wanted a physical copy, they could use it.  

###### **Why?**
On the off chance that anyone visits my website (assuming I get this all done for people to actually use it), I would like my users to download my resume on the off chance that they would like to use it future job opportunities.

###### **Notice**
This is my personal site that I am building. So there are many files on my Github that are not being used for this exploration. For this exploration I only used files "personal.html".
The others are for my own personal use. To access this site, please go to http://www.niclenz.me/personal.html
My Github repository is **nalyv2Exploration3CS4830:**

###### **Sources**
Because I had already made a modal in my first exploration, I reused the code that it and made some minor adjustments.

Once I made my modal, I put in an image tag, but when I did, my image took up the entire screen instead of just the modal. So I luckily found this link:

This link helped me by telling me to add the img-responsive class to my img tag.

Then I wanted to make a button that the user could click if they wanted to download my resume to keep. I then found this link:
* https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_download.asp

And was able to add a button and have the user download my resume.

Here is my modal code when tying everything together:

###### **Recap**
Overall I am very happy with how everything turned out. Since I already did the hard part (making the modal) it was very easy doing the rest. All it took was some minor Google-ing to figure out the minor problems I was having.

In conclusion, this was a very fun activity and think I will use this code for future projects.

###### **Proof It Works**

Here are screenshots of my resume modal along with me clicking the download button and view the downloaded resume.
