# **Social Media Widget**

###### **Objective:**
This week's exploration goal is to create social media floating buttons, so that my users may share my site on any of their social websites. Hopefully this will help create publicity for my page and for anyone else that chooses to use this!

###### **Why?**
Social media has taken over the Internet. Everyone we know uses it and everyone advertises on the Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even Snapchat. With knowing this, I wanted to help make my website easy to share for everyone with just a click of a button!

###### **Notice**
This is my personal site that I am building. So there are many files on my Github that are not being used for this exploration. For this exploration I only used files "personal.html".
The others are for my own personal use. To access this site, please go to http://www.niclenz.me/personal.html
My Github repository is **nalyv2Exploration2CS4830:**

###### **Sources**
Because I did not know where to start with this, I did a bunch of Googling and stumbled upon this website:
* https://www.jimdo.com/blog/20-widgets-to-improve-your-website/

  This link was the biggest component of my exploration. While it gave me plenty of other ideas for future additions to my website, the third one down discussed social media.

  It was the PERFECT example of what I was wanting on my webpage. It suggested I go to:

  Where if you scroll down to Share Buttons and click Get Started you can choose which style you want!

   I decided to go with the Floating Bar, so then I clicked Activate.

  From there you are able to customize your very own floating bar! You can change the icons that pop up, arrange the order in which they appear, the orientation of the floating bar (left, or right side of desktop), the colors and so much more! So I created mine and clicked "Save & Continue."

  After my first time playing with this website, it took me to the "Get The Code" page where all I had to do was copy this script and paste them directly above my body's close tag. That. Was. It. Save and refresh your page and you have yourself a floating bar that'll directly share your site with whatever platform you allow! The best part? It was all free! You can create as many as you want for whenever there's a new platform you want to be shared on.

###### **Recap**
Overall I am very happy with how everything turned out. I did not think this task would be an easy one, so it was to my surprise that this went so smoothly. Though it did not take much to do, it took a lot of research to get what I wanted. I did not know what to type into Google to even get an idea of where to start, so that would have to be my issue.

In conclusion, this was a very fun activity and think I will use this code for future projects. It is a fun little gadget to have and is very practical to use!

###### **Proof It Works**

I chose to have the Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, Email, and Print options available for my users.
